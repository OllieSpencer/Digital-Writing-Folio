## Defining Electronic Literature

 This sounds silly but the elements of Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution and Shade that we read are the written passages contained within each work, separate from any text included only as an interactive element. Although sometimes in digital writing it’s the text itself that we interact with, hypertext for example. The ‘Next page’ button in First Draft of the Revolution is an example of text that is inevitably ‘read’. but wouldn’t be considered the core subject matter that we read to properly consume and understand the work. The fictional text that appears on the next page after the button is clicked is what we read, in terms of the question.

Espen Aarseth’s typology of cybertext helps explain this distinction. According to his model, texts differ not only in their narrative content but in how users engage with them—whether they simply interpret the text or actively traverse it in nonlinear, variable ways. In the case of First Draft of the Revolution, the button facilitates traversal, but the core narrative exists in the unfolding fictional entries, which require interpretive reading (Hayles 2007).

The way in which these elements are meaningful is they carry the intended message and subject matter of the electronic literature, and without them we’d simply be clicking through an interactive website viewing picture and videos without consuming any written content. They add a dimension to electronic literature that separates it from video games and websites and gives it an intellectual quality and deeper meaning. That’s not to say that interactive text that doesn’t convey subject matter isn’t meaningful. Without these elements we’d just be reading text on a screen, like an article or blog.
 
Electronic literature works are read differently in that traditional literature is typically read in a linear, sequential fashion and is intended as a cohesive whole or continuous narrative. That’s not to say there aren’t non-linear examples of non-electronic literature, but non-linearity is more common in electronic literature. This stems largely from the interactivity aspect of digital works, and how the ‘reader’ can often have a significant impact on the order and way the work is consumed. For example, the electronic poem The Gathering Cloud and the interactive fiction piece Shade are heavily interactive, with reader decision making steering the flow of each piece.

Electronic literature is different from print literature in a variety of ways. Firstly, the medium is obviously completely different. While we hold books, zines and flyers in their physical form and flip through pages in a sequential manner as we read, electronic literature is digital and often non-sequential, as stated previously. Half the work put into digital works is also the coding and computing side of things, which takes ages and is covered by a whole different skillset. Print authors don’t share in this as no additional expertise is required to create their work aside from an ability to write.

Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution and Shade all share in they must be accessed via a computer or website, a fundamental characteristic of electronic literature. Other digital qualities are their interactive elements, such as the reader’s navigation through The Gathering Cloud and the reader’s control over the story in Shade. The randomisation created through coding algorithms in Taroko Gorge is a perfect example of a unique quality of electronic literature as well. Furthermore, their non-linearity and use of graphics are also common characteristics within digital writing.
