# Digital Writing Folio

Ello, ello. I’m Ollie and you’re currently ranching through my GitHub. I’m a hopeful writer who particularly enjoys crafting screenplays and exploring my experiences/what’s in front of me through creative non-fiction. I’ve previously focused on journalism but have lapsed in favour of creative pursuits. Before transferring into the Creative Writing major at RMIT I completed their Advanced Diploma of Professional Screenwriting. I’ve grown up here in Melbourne surrounded by a lot of artists, writers, musicians, graffiti writers, skateboarders and other degenerates who have hugely influenced me and what I focus on in my writing. Going forward I’d like to explore urban decay and industrialisation through both writing and photography, while now I’m milking everything I can out of my adventures across the country on freight trains.
