## Week 1

Storyland (2004) by Nanette Wylde, from Volume 1 of the Electronic Literature Collection is indeed digital writing as it’s a combinatorial story generated using a computer. A combinatorial story is a fun way to give the reader a different narrative every time they visit the piece. The way it works if I understand it correctly is Wylde would have written an assortment of different options that slot into a specific part of a generated story, for example they wrote 10 beginnings, 10 middles and 10 ends. The algorithm then spits these out in different orders every time the reader hits the button. I love it, it’s clever writing each of the passages in such a way that they read coherently regardless of what other passages they end up with.

Letter to Linus (2001) by William Gillespie is a super interesting form of hypertext that Gillespie describes as a ‘hypercube’, a disjointed reading experience determined by the six faces that form the structure of a cube. Each face of the cube links to another four pages. Everything is tied together by another six words that relate to each face of the cube. I admire Gillespie experimental and ambitious approach to this piece, and that he’s combines poesis and prose to form whatever narrative the reader gets, which of course varies depending on the order in which they click. Check it out in Volume 2.

Uncle Roger (1986) by Judy Malloy was first written using the BASIC programming language and later adapted for the web that we know today. You can find it in Volume 3 of the Electronic Literature Collection. It’s an interactive, nonlinear ‘narrabase’, split into three parts: ‘A Party in Woodside,’ ‘The Blue Notebook,’ and ‘Terminals.’ The story is told through short, fragmented pieces of text that resemble diary entries. They piece together to tell a larger story about the narrator’s experiences working in Silicon Valley, as well as dynamics of the family they babysit for. This one was a nice change of pace from the more ambiguous, disjointed pieces I’d already sussed as you could quite easily follow Malloy’s experiences. It felt like more of a story despite the hypertext navigation.

The Buoy (2019) by Meredith Morran is an incredible piece of poetic autofiction that is delivered via a performative PowerPoint presentation, or in this case a video of the author delivering said presentation, positioning it firmly withing digital writing as it can’t really be anything else. I really love this one, by far my favourite so far. I’ve never actually encountered anything quite like it. It begins as though an academic presentation that quickly reveals itself to be a humorous poetic presentation that I’d highly recommend.

What aspects of the remix are the same?

The elements that have remained the same between Dystopian dreams and Palamos dreams, my remix, are the way in which the subjects, verbs and objects are arranged and spat out the other end. The code that groups the words into sentences functions as it did before.

What aspects of the remix are different?

The differences are the subjects, verbs and objects. This in turn has changed the meanings of the sentences that the code creates, affecting the tone of the poem. I have also changed the colour of the font to suit the video of Palamos from my camera roll which I’ve made the background. 

Is the remix successful?

The core idea of the digital poem remains while my own spin on it is now at the forefront, which is the very essence of the remix format. Therefore, I’d say Palamos dreams is successful. 

How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
I’m loving it, it was of course daunting at first, but after seeing how AI can be used to learn the different languages I’m hooked. I’m excited to use code in the creation of my final project.

Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

It hasn’t changed the way I read the written components of e-lit, i.e. the poetics or prose, but I’m now considering the process undergone to create the works from a coding perspective, and how complicated it must have been to create some of them.
