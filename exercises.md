## Week 1 Exercises

[Twelve Blue](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/joyce__twelve_blue.html) by Michael Joyce is a fairly simple piece of hypertext created using Storyspace, which can be found in Volume One of the Electronic Literature Collection. It’s use of randomisation, image-mapping and hypertext are why it’s considered digital writing. These elements aren’t found in other forms of literature. I rather like this piece. Despite its digital medium, it evokes quite a nostalgic, melancholic and fuzzy feeling when I click through and read the different passages. I also dig how you can read through in a pre-determined order, but also jump randomly through the content via the image-map as well.
