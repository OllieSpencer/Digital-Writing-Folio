## Week 1

Storyland (2004) by Nanette Wylde, from Volume 1 of the Electronic Literature Collection is indeed digital writing as it’s a combinatorial story generated using a computer. A combinatorial story is a fun way to give the reader a different narrative every time they visit the piece. The way it works if I understand it correctly is Wylde would have written an assortment of different options that slot into a specific part of a generated story, for example they wrote 10 beginnings, 10 middles and 10 ends. The algorithm then spits these out in different orders every time the reader hits the button. I love it, it’s clever writing each of the passages in such a way that they read coherently regardless of what other passages they end up with.

Letter to Linus (2001) by William Gillespie is a super interesting form of hypertext that Gillespie describes as a ‘hypercube’, a disjointed reading experience determined by the six faces that form the structure of a cube. Each face of the cube links to another four pages. Everything is tied together by another six words that relate to each face of the cube. I admire Gillespie experimental and ambitious approach to this piece, and that he’s combines poesis and prose to form whatever narrative the reader gets, which of course varies depending on the order in which they click. Check it out in Volume 2.

Uncle Roger (1986) by Judy Malloy was first written using the BASIC programming language and later adapted for the web that we know today. You can find it in Volume 3 of the Electronic Literature Collection. It’s an interactive, nonlinear ‘narrabase’, split into three parts: ‘A Party in Woodside,’ ‘The Blue Notebook,’ and ‘Terminals.’ The story is told through short, fragmented pieces of text that resemble diary entries. They piece together to tell a larger story about the narrator’s experiences working in Silicon Valley, as well as dynamics of the family they babysit for. This one was a nice change of pace from the more ambiguous, disjointed pieces I’d already sussed as you could quite easily follow Malloy’s experiences. It felt like more of a story despite the hypertext navigation.

The Buoy (2019) by Meredith Morran is an incredible piece of poetic autofiction that is delivered via a performative PowerPoint presentation, or in this case a video of the author delivering said presentation, positioning it firmly withing digital writing as it can’t really be anything else. I really love this one, by far my favourite so far. I’ve never actually encountered anything quite like it. It begins as though an academic presentation that quickly reveals itself to be a humorous poetic presentation that I’d highly recommend.

## Week 3

**What aspects of the remix are the same?**

The elements that have remained the same between Dystopian dreams and Palamos dreams, my remix, are the way in which the subjects, verbs and objects are arranged and spat out the other end. The code that groups the words into sentences functions as it did before.

**What aspects of the remix are different?**

The differences are the subjects, verbs and objects. This in turn has changed the meanings of the sentences that the code creates, affecting the tone of the poem. I have also changed the colour of the font to suit the video of Palamos from my camera roll which I’ve made the background. 

**Is the remix successful?**

The core idea of the digital poem remains while my own spin on it is now at the forefront, which is the very essence of the remix format. Therefore, I’d say Palamos dreams is successful. 

**How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?**

I’m loving it, it was of course daunting at first, but after seeing how AI can be used to learn the different languages I’m hooked. I’m excited to use code in the creation of my final project.

**Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?**

It hasn’t changed the way I read the written components of e-lit, i.e. the poetics or prose, but I’m now considering the process undergone to create the works from a coding perspective, and how complicated it must have been to create some of them.

## Student Works

House on the Hill by Lara Scuri is an interactive fiction piece told through a Bitsy game. The reader, or player, is filled in on the background of the story at the beginning, then controls an avatar within the game, who makes their way through a haunted house, triggering text to appear throughout which develops the story and the fictional character. The digital works conveys the inner turmoil of the character, which could well be the representative of the author, in relation to their family. The haunted house, at least to me, is a metaphor for the dark parts of the characters past and the spaces they occupy in their mind. I personally can’t identify a connection between the piece’s theme and its format as a digital game, but the visual aid of the haunted house and its creepy contents aids definitely aids in the storytelling. 

Snow Season by Tanna Sulzberger is one of my favourite digital works I’ve read anywhere. The poetic short story they’ve written is broken up by the way Sulzberger has arranged the text across each page into these somewhat ergodic passages which have varying paces and tones depending on how they’ve been laid out. Consequently, the digital medium and how this has enabled the arrangements is an important aspect of the work. That’s not to say Sulzberger couldn’t have created similar arrangements in a Word document or on a piece of paper, but this sort of delivery is most effective using digital tools, in this case Twine. The piece is accompanied by terrific images of the area in which the narrator resides, a cold, stark, but beautiful place. Likely somewhere significant to Sulzberger, who I’m assuming took the photos. The wintery vibe of the backgrounds pair perfectly with the melancholic subject matter of the writing, another way the digital medium aids in conveying the theme of the work.

## Towards Assessment 2

I’ve already begun working on my final piece and have clocked about 20 hours on it so far this month. I know this as Glitch keeps a handy tab on how much time is spent on each project, which can be viewed on the ‘Dashboard.’ It’s evolving into an interactive hypertextual non-fiction piece that fragmentally tracks two separate trips a friend and I have taken on freight trains across Australia over the past two years. One to Perth and one to Sydney. It’s in the form of an interactive website featuring photos and videos from both trips that are becoming a significant aspect of the interactive experience. Text interacts with multimedia and vice versa. Lucinda’s points on how e-literature relates to screenwriting are now crystal clear after beginning work on this project. The multimedia aspects resemble a film the reader is watching while the text component is serving as a kind of script, not to mention the code acting as a kind of script as well. 

So far, Glitch has been used for the creation of the project/website, and I’ve been uploading the HTML, CSS and JS files to GitHub as I go. Each deployment on GitHub has been tracking my progress. I’ve drawn inspiration from Uncle Roger, the piece I looked at for my Case Study. It’s use of hypertext to navigate diary like entries is very similar to my own project, except mine utilises multimedia to aid in the conveying of information. Uncle Roger also varies each time the reader interacts with it, I hope to produce a similar effect. I’d like the reader to get a different order of events every time they visit the site. So far, I’ve only made progress on one branch of the story, with other branches to be completed by the end of the semester. In terms of planning the hypertext flow, the two main branches will be the two different trips, Sydney and Perth, with each hyperlink corresponding to different locations along each route. My aim once the project is complete is for the reader to be able to chop and change between locations and journeys, depending on which hyperlinks they choose to follow.

## Proposal

My piece is a travelogue combined with critical reflections on colonialism, conveyed through an interactive website created using Glitch. The travelling in question is two trips a mate and I took to different parts of Australia on freight trains. My intention for the piece is to explore the juxtaposition of Australia’s colonial context against the wanderlust many have here and the itch to roam and explore this ginormous and dynamic landscape. The themes then would be colonialism, exploration and isolation. It’s a non-fiction piece that reads like journal entries from each trip. It could be considered narrative driven, as it covers event’s chronologically when read in order, but that may not be the how the reader receives the work depending on how they click through the content. 

I’d like to communicate our journeys and the wild events that occurred throughout each, as well as ruminations on the white settler narrative and the stereotypical portrayal of Australia as an alien landscape there to be bested. I’d also like to communicate the feelings of melancholic irony I felt at different parts of each trip, triggered by witnessing how much colonial infrastructure has tainted the Australian landscape, including the railway itself. I’d like the reader to feel a sense of excitement from the stories, while also holding an awareness of the problematic nature of said stories, which I hope the critical reflections accompanying the stories will help to achieve. From here I need to develop the written piece itself into its final form. I’d like the reader to feel the movement of the freight adventures as they click through the story, read the passages and gander at the photos and clips. 

The reader’s momentum through the piece will be driven by the momentum of the journeys themselves. Every page is a different location or event from one of the two trips, so as the reader clicks through its as though they’re going on the journey themselves, I’m hoping this will nudge them along and keep them engaged. The digital feeds into this as the reader has to click and interact with the work in order to advance, the multimedia will also aid in immersing the reader, which is another perk of using a digital medium. The energy of the interactive and digital aspects of the work will hopefully match what I intend to be exciting stories. Both elements acting together will ideally convey the movement and motion of what I’m trying to do here, which would be much harder to achieve with a plain old article written in the traditional way. I do still have to finish the written portion of the work, so hopefully I can flesh out the thematics in more detail so as to generate more momentum within the piece, alongside the literary and digital elements. 


In total, I don’t think my piece will be more than 1200 words but we’ll see how I go. If I complete it according to what I’ve roughly mapped out it should be ten screens all up. Considering how long it’s taken me to complete two and a half screens, I’m sceptical as to whether I can finish this along with my folio by the end of semester, I may have to cut a few locations or just focus on one trip instead of two, I’m not sure. In terms of the tech, I think I’ve wrapped my head around enough at this point to complete the work in the way I want to.

## Reflection

If I’m being completely honest, I chose this studio as the other two options were strongly unappealing to me. I had no idea what to expect from Digital Writing but it definitely grabbed me the most and sounded interesting. Prior to the studio I had no knowledge of digital writing or electronic literature. I’d never even read a piece of electronic literature, or written a single line of code. I was very green. The moment I understood what the studio was all about I became super excited to start coding and learn the basics, as it’s something I’ve wanted to learn for ages. I was initially super worried that I needed some level of prior knowledge of coding and computing, but I was mistaken and incredibly relieved when I realised I wasn’t the only one who had no idea what they were doing. 

What stood out to me about the studio overall was just how different it was to anything I’d done before during the course, or even outside the course. Any creative endeavour that challenges you to learn new skills and open up to a new way of creating is valuable. I never would have created what I’ve created if not prompted by the studio. It’s introduced a whole new world of writing to experience that I didn’t know existed before, and has shown me how versatile my practice can be. The raw coding portion of the class in Glitch stood out to me which is ultimately why I went that way with Catching Out. Coding always seemed so distant and so foreign, therefore learning the basics and putting a piece of work together has been quite satisfying. It was great being able to combine writing with a visual medium in the form of a website. I’ve always loved design and got really stuck into that side of Catching Out, perhaps too stuck in at the expense of the work’s literary elements now that I look back on the process.

My final project was inspired by freight hopping and other obscure travel related stories, I’ve wanted to write about the freight trips since I started doing it and have dabbled a little but haven’t seen anything through to completion. As I mentioned in the proposal, I was inspired by wild travel stories published in the now out of print Melbourne publication Lost on Earth. I think their page layouts also subconsciously influenced the visual design of Catching Out as well.

The original scope of my idea proved to be too large for the time I had to complete it and so, as you’ll see, I whittled the piece down to just the Sydney trip as opposed to including the Perth trip as well, except there’s a little Perth surprise at the end of the work. I’ll definitely continue to experiment with electronic literature after the class, and hopefully finish working on Catching Out until it’s finished to the extent I had initially planned. Experimenting with digital formats has changed how I think about how my writing can be used, and I’m keen to play around with them going forward.
